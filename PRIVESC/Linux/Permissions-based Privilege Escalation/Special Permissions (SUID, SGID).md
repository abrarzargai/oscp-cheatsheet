### What are Special Permissions?

In Linux, **special permissions** like `setuid` and `setgid` allow a program to run with **someone elseâ€™s permissions**, usually a more powerful user like `root`. This can be **dangerous** if a program is insecure or misconfigured.

### 1. **What is setuid?**
- **setuid** = _Set User ID_
- If a file has the **setuid** bit set (`s` in place of `x`), it **runs as the file owner**, even if another user runs it.
- This is usually used to let **regular users run root-owned programs as root**.

ðŸ”Ž Example command to find these:
```bash
find / -user root -perm -4000 -exec ls -ldb {} \; 2>/dev/null
```
This shows all files **owned by root** with **setuid** permissions.

ðŸ“Œ Example result:
```bash
-rwsr-xr-x 1 root root ... /usr/bin/passwd
```

The `s` in `rwsr-xr-x` means setuid is set. This program runs as `root` even when run by a normal user.

---

### ðŸ§ª Why is setuid interesting for hacking?

If the program is **poorly written**, a hacker might trick it into doing something like **spawning a root shell**, giving **full control of the system**.---

---

### ðŸ‘¥ 2. **What is setgid?**
- **setgid** = _Set Group ID_
- It works like setuid, but instead of running as the file's **owner**, it runs as the file's **group**.

ðŸ”Ž Command to find these:
```bash
find / -uid 0 -perm -6000 -type f 2>/dev/null
```
ðŸ“Œ Example result:
```
`-rwsr-sr-x 1 root root ... /usr/lib/snapd/snap-confine`
```
The `s` in the **group section** means setgid is set.

# Exploiting SUID Binaries

```bash
# SUID
find / -type f -perm -u=s 2>/dev/null
find / -type f -perm -04000 2>/dev/null
find / -user root -perm -4000 -exec ls -ldb {} \; 2>/dev/null

# SGID
find / -type f -perm -g=s 2>/dev/null
find / -type f -perm -02000 2>/dev/null
find / -user root -perm -2000 -exec ls -ldb {} \; 2>/dev/null
```
