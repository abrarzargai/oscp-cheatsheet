# Misconfigured SUDO Privileges

Sometimes, users are allowed to run certain commands with `sudo` **without a password**, which can be abused to gain **root access**.

### 🔍 Step 1: Check Your Sudo Permissions

Use this command to see what you're allowed to run as `sudo`:

```bash
sudo -l
```

**Explanation**:

- Lists commands you can run with `sudo`
- Shows whether a password is required or not

> 🎯 You're looking for any binary listed that can be abused to escalate privileges.

This means the user (e.g., `student`) can run the `man` command **as root without a password**.

### 🧰 Step 2: Look Up the Binary on GTFOBins

Check https://gtfobins.github.io for the binary.

Search: **"man"**

According to GTFOBins, `man` can be used to get a shell like this:

Checking it further

Now we are going to follow the same instruction 

```bash
sudo man man
```

After that we will run the command 

```bash
!/bin/sh
```

After this you drop into a **root shell**

Similiary you can check if there is another binary are allowed to run with **SUDO** permission without password
