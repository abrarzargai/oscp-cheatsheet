### Privilege Escalation

We will use the **[GTFOBIN](https://gtfobins.github.io/gtfobins/docker/)** to elevate privileges on the target machine. It tells us that in order to get out of the restricted environment of docker, we need to spawn an interactive shell inside the docker.

We run the script directly from the GTFOBIN. However, it gave us an error stating that it was unable to find the alpine image. Therefore, we use the docker ps -a command to list the images available on this Docker instance. We observe that there is an image named bash. As a result, we replace the image name from alpine to bash in the command. After running the modified command again, we find that we are able to gain root access. Finally, we use the cat command to read the private key for the root user, as required to conclude this machine.

```
docker run -v /:/mnt --rm -it alpine chroot /mnt sh

docker ps -a

docker run -v /:/mnt --rm -it bash chroot /mnt sh
```
