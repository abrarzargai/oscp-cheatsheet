The **Linux kernel** is the core of the operating system — it controls everything from memory to processes to devices.
Sometimes, **bugs (vulnerabilities)** are found in specific kernel versions. These can be **exploited** to gain **root (admin) access**, even if you’re just a normal user.

By exploiting vulnerabilities in the Linux Kernel we can sometimes escalate our privileges. What we usually need to know to test if a kernel exploit works is the OS, architecture and kernel version.

Check the following:
- OS:
- Architecture:
- Kernel version:

```bash
uname -a # Check kernel version
cat /etc/lsb-release # Check OS version
cat /proc/version
cat /etc/issue
```

Don't use kernel exploits if you can avoid it. If you use it it might crash the machine or put it in an unstable state. So kernel exploits should be the last resort
