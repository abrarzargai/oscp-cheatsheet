# Kernel Exploits
By exploiting vulnerabilities in the Linux Kernel we can sometimes escalate our privileges. What we usually need to know to test if a kernel exploit works is the OS, architecture and kernel version.

Check the following:
- OS:
- Architecture:
- Kernel version:

```bash
uname -a
cat /proc/version
cat /etc/issue
```
Search for exploits
```

```
Don't use kernel exploits if you can avoid it. If you use it it might crash the machine or put it in an unstable state. So kernel exploits should be the last resort
