# Windows Service Exploitation

### ðŸ”§ **Windows Services**

Windows uses *services* to run background programs (like antivirus, updates, etc.). These services are controlled by a system tool called **SCM (Service Control Manager)**.

Each service:

- Runs a specific `.exe` file (called **BINARY_PATH_NAME**).
- Uses a specific user account (like `LocalSystem`, `svcuser1`, etc.).
- Has **permissions (DACL)** to control who can start, stop, or change it.

### What is a Service?

A **service** is a background process running on Windows, similar to a **daemon** on Linux. It starts automatically or on-demand and runs without a user interface, typically providing essential system or application functions.

### Misconfigurations

1. Modifiable Binary Path (BinPath)
2. Unquoted Service Path
3. Weak Registry Permissions
4. Insecure Executable Permissions
5. DLL Hijacking
