### What is the Kernel?

The **kernel** is the **core part of Windows** that controls how software talks to the hardware (CPU, RAM, etc.).If you find a **bug (exploit)** in the kernel, you might get **admin (SYSTEM)** level access.

- ⚠️ **Warning:** Kernel exploits are risky and may crash the system. Only test them in a **safe lab environment**, not on real machines.
