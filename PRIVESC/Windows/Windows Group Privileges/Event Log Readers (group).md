If auditing of process creation events and command-line logging is enabled, Event ID 4688 is saved in the Windows Security Event Log.
This log contains useful details like:
- Which process was run
- What command-line arguments were used

This information is very helpful for defenders and can be forwarded to log analysis tools like: SIEM (e.g., Splunk), ElasticSearchetc

These tools help detect suspicious commands such as:whoami, netstat, tasklist etc

Organizations can also use AppLocker to block specific commands entirely.

#### Real-World Example
A pentester ran tasklist from a finance user's workstation.
Since the organization had command-line auditing enabled, the security team spotted and stopped this activity ‚Äî even without an enterprise EDR!.

Admins sometimes add power users or developers to this group to provide visibility without granting full admin rights.

### Check Group Membership
```cmd
net localgroup "Event Log Readers"
```

If you see your username listed, it means you have read access to event logs.

### Why Is This Dangerous?
Many Windows commands expose credentials in cleartext on the command line.
If command-line logging is enabled, sensitive data may appear in Event ID 4688 logs, making it possible for attackers or defenders to extract passwords!

### How to Search Security Logs
 Using wevtutil (Command Prompt or PowerShell)
You can search for specific strings (like /user) in the Security logs:

```powershell
wevtutil qe Security /rd:true /f:text | Select-String "/user"

# Example Output:
Process Command Line: net use T: \\fs01\backups /user:tim MyStr0ngP@ssword
```

 
üîπ Pass Credentials Remotely to wevtutil
```cmd
wevtutil qe Security /rd:true /f:text /r:share01 /u:julie.clay /p:Welcome1 | findstr "/user"
```
- /r: Remote host
- /u: Username
- /p: Password

üîπ Using PowerShell: Get-WinEvent
‚ö†Ô∏è Requires full admin rights
(Being in the Event Log Readers group is not enough unless registry permissions are changed.)

```powershell
Get-WinEvent -LogName Security | Where {
$.ID -eq 4688 -and $.Properties[8].Value -like "/user"
} | Select-Object @{Name="CommandLine";Expression={$_.Properties[8].Value}}

#Example Output:

net use T: \\fs01\backups /user:tim MyStr0ngP@ssword
```
You can also run this as another user:

```powershell
Get-WinEvent ... -Credential (Get-Credential)
```
