### **What Is Kerberos Delegation?**

In **Active Directory**, **Kerberos Delegation** allows a service (like a web app) to **act on behalf of a user** to access resources (like a database) on another server **using that user’s credentials**.

Think of it like this:

> 🧑 User → 🌐 Web Server → 🗄️ SQL Server
> 
> 
> Kerberos Delegation allows the web server to say:
> 
> "**Hey SQL server, I’m acting on behalf of Bob. Let me access his data.**"
> 

Without delegation, only **Bob** can directly talk to the SQL server. The web server wouldn't be able to say "I’m Bob."

### 🧠 **Why Is Delegation Useful?**

Imagine a front-end app (like Outlook Web App) needs to access a backend (like Exchange or SharePoint) **as the user** to pull their emails or files. That backend will only trust the user, not the web server.

So the server needs a way to **pretend to be the user**, **securely**, and that’s where **Kerberos Delegation** helps.

## 📦 There Are 3 Types of Delegation:

### 🟥 1. **Unconstrained Delegation (Old & Dangerous)**

🧠 **What it means:**

- Web Server can act as *any* user.
- It can talk to *any* service while pretending to be that user.
- **Very risky** because if a hacker gets control of that web server, they can **impersonate anyone** in the domain.

💬 **Real-world example:**

> Imagine a receptionist can use anyone’s badge to access any room in the office.
> 

💣 **Abuse Risk:** Super high. You get TGTs and can become Domain Admin if one logs in.

### 🟨 2. **Constrained Delegation (KCD)**

🧠 **What it means:**

- Web Server can impersonate users, but **only for specific services**.
- AD admins configure: "This server can only act on behalf of users to reach the SQL Server."

💬 **Real-world example:**

> Receptionist can only use your badge to access the kitchen, not HR, IT, or Finance.
> 

✅ Safer. Can still be abused if attacker controls the web server.

### 🟩 3. **Resource-Based Constrained Delegation (RBCD)**

🧠 **What it means:**

- Instead of **giving the receptionist power**, the **kitchen itself decides** who can act on behalf of users.
- The **target service** (SQL Server) says: "Only `WebServer01` is allowed to impersonate users to me."

💬 **Real-world example:**

> The kitchen makes a list: “Only these people are allowed to bring other people's badges here.”
> 

✅ Most secure. Used in modern systems (cloud, automation).

💣 **If attacker can change this list, they can sneak in**.

## 🔐 Big Picture: Why Does It Matter in Hacking?

If you find any of these delegation settings as an attacker:

- 🟥 **Unconstrained** → Steal tickets, impersonate Domain Admin
- 🟨 **KCD** → Abuse to impersonate users to services
- 🟩 **RBCD** → Add yourself to the list → pretend to be anyone
