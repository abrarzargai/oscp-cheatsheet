So we have scenario from bloodhound as mentioned below where we have the access of `SVCSERVMAN` user access and You want to **hack into a Windows server (THMSERVER2)** by exploiting something in **Active Directory** called a **GPO (Group Policy Object)**.

**Each icon in the bloodhound has meaning as we can see here**

explain the image from bloodhound about each node

### 🔵 `svcServMan@za.tryhackme.loc`

- **Icon:** Green person
- **Type:** 🧑‍💼 **User**
- Meaning: This is a domain user account.

### 🟣 `Management Server Pushes@za.tryhackme.loc`

- **Icon:** Three horizontal purple lines (like a stacked list)
- **Type:** 📄 **GPO (Group Policy Object)**
- Meaning: This is a GPO, which defines configuration settings for target machines.

### 🟧 `Management Servers@za.tryhackme.loc`

- **Icon:** Yellow with a hierarchy/tree diagram
- **Type:** 🗂️ **Organizational Unit (OU)**
- Meaning: This is an AD container that groups multiple computers/users.

### 🔴 `thmserver2.za.tryhackme.loc`

- **Icon:** Red screen/monitor
- **Type:** 💻 **Computer**
- Meaning: This is a regular Windows computer or server (could be a workstation or member server)

### explain about the relations:

### ✅ 1. **`SVCSERVMAN@ZA.TRYHACKME.LOC` → GenericWrite → `MANAGEMENT SERVER PUSHES@ZA.TRYHACKME.LOC`**

- This says:
    
    🔐 The user `svcServMan` has **GenericWrite** access on a **GPO (Group Policy Object)** named `Management Server Pushes`.
    

📌 **What is GenericWrite?**

It means `svcServMan` can **edit** the GPO — like adding users to local groups or changing system rules etc.

### ✅ 2. **`MANAGEMENT SERVER PUSHES@ZA.TRYHACKME.LOC` → GpLink → `MANAGEMENT SERVERS@ZA.TRYHACKME.LOC`**

- This means:
    
    🧩 This GPO is **linked to** the Organizational Unit (OU) called `Management Servers`.
    

📌 That means **all computers** inside this OU will follow the rules defined in the GPO.

### ✅ 3. **`MANAGEMENT SERVERS@ZA.TRYHACKME.LOC` → Contains → `THMSERVER2.ZA.TRYHACKME.LOC`**

- This says:
    
    🖥️ The server `THMSERVER2` is **inside** the OU named `Management Servers`.
    

📌 So this server will **automatically apply** the settings from the GPO every ~15 minutes.

In simple words: **You have the power to change settings** that get automatically applied to that server.

## 🧱 **What is a GPO (Group Policy Object)?**

- Think of a GPO like a **set of rules or instructions** that get applied to computers in a network.
- Examples:
    - Add users to the local Administrator group.
    - Run a script on startup.
    - Change firewall settings.

🗂️ These GPOs live in a folder called **SYSVOL**, which all computers in the network can read from.

🖥️ All **domain-joined computers** check these settings **every 15 minutes**, and apply any new ins

## How to exploit it :

As we already have the user credentials (suppose named `xyz`) from IT Support group then :

- ✅ **We compromised `svcServMan`**, a user with `GenericWrite` access to a GPO called **`Management Server Pushes`**.
- 🧠 **That GPO is linked** to an OU called **`Management Servers`**, which includes our target system **`THMSERVER2`**.
- 🛠️ We edited the GPO using **Group Policy Management (MMC)** and added the **`IT Support`** group to:
    - `Administrators`
    - `Remote Desktop Users`
- 🕒 GPOs are automatically applied every **15 minutes** (or instantly via `gpupdate /force` on the target).
- 💥 Once the GPO applies, **any user in IT Support** becomes:
    - A **local admin** on THMSERVER2
    - Able to **RDP into the machine**
