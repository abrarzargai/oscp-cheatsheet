Port forwarding is like **creating a secret tunnel** that lets you access a service (like a database, website, or SSH server) that’s **not directly reachable** from your machine.

- **Problem**: You can’t connect to a service (e.g., port `3306` for MySQL) because it’s blocked or hidden.
- **Solution**: Forward that port through a machine you **already control** (like a hacked server).
