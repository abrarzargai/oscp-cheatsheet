## What is Plink?

**Plink** is like the **Windows command-line version of SSH** (it comes with PuTTY).  
It helps Windows users **connect to other machines via SSH**, just like `ssh` does on Linux.

You can also use it to create **SOCKS proxies** or **port forwarding tunnels** ‚Äî even from a Windows machine.
## Why Use Plink?

Imagine this scenario:

- You have access to a **Windows machine** (either it's your attack box or a compromised one).
- You want to pivot or forward traffic to other internal systems (like Ubuntu or another Windows target).
- But you **can‚Äôt install tools freely** (due to antivirus or being monitored).

So instead of downloading hacking tools, you can use **Plink** (if it‚Äôs already on the system or you can grab it quietly from a file share).

### Step 1: Run Plink to Create a SOCKS Proxy
You run this command from the **Windows host**:
```bash
plink -ssh -D 9050 ubuntu@10.129.15.50
```

üß† This means:

> ‚ÄúCreate an SSH tunnel to the Ubuntu machine and open a SOCKS proxy server on **localhost:9050**.‚Äù

ü™ü Plink listens on **port 9050** on your Windows machine.
### ### Step 2: Route Other Programs Through That Tunnel

But how do you actually **use that SOCKS proxy**?

You can use a Windows tool called **Proxifier**:

- It tells Windows apps (like RDP, browsers, or Nmap) to **send traffic through the SOCKS proxy**.
- It takes care of the magic behind the scenes.

Proxifier is just like `proxychains` but for Windows.

#### ### Step 3: RDP to a Windows Target

Once Proxifier is set up to use:
```bash
127.0.0.1:9050 (SOCKS4)
```
You can open `mstsc.exe` (Remote Desktop Connection) and connect to:
```bash
172.16.5.19
