# SSH

```
ssh -L 1234:localhost:3306 ubuntu@10.129.202.64
```
- `-L 1234:localhost:3306` → this means:
    - Listen on **your local port 1234**,
    - And forward anything sent there to the **remote server's port 3306** (MySQL).
- Now you can open MySQL locally on `localhost:1234` — even though it lives on the remote system.
```
`netstat -antp | grep 1234`
```

Check if Port Forward Worked. if Shows that port 1234 is listening on your machine (thanks to SSH).
#### Forward Multiple Ports
```bash
ssh -L 1234:localhost:3306 -L 8080:localhost:80 ubuntu@10.129.202.64
```
