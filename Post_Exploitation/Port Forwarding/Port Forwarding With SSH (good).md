..# SSH

```
ssh -L [local_port]:[target_host]:[target_port] user@ssh_server
```


```
ssh -L 1234:localhost:3306 ubuntu@10.129.202.64
```
- `-L 1234:localhost:3306` → this means:
    - Listen on **your local port 1234**,
    - And forward anything sent there to the **remote server's port 3306** (MySQL).
- Now you can open MySQL locally on `localhost:1234` — even though it lives on the remote system.
```
`netstat -antp | grep 1234`
```

Check if Port Forward Worked. if Shows that port 1234 is listening on your machine (thanks to SSH).
#### Forward Multiple Ports
```bash
ssh -L 1234:localhost:3306 -L 8080:localhost:80 ubuntu@10.129.202.64
```


## Pivot into the internal network & RDP to 172.16.5.19

```bash
# Logs into `10.129.163.33` and makes a SOCKS proxy on port 9050 to reach internal hosts through it.
ssh -D 9050 ubuntu@10.129.163.33

# Edit `/etc/proxychains.conf` and make sure the last line is:

proxychains nmap -Pn -sT -p 3389 172.16.5.19 # Verify reachability
proxychains xfreerdp /v:172.16.5.19 /u:victor /p:'pass@123' #Connect via RDP
