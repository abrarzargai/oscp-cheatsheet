- **Think of it like this:** You’ve hacked one computer (`A`), and you want to reach computer `B`, but `B` is on a private network you can't see.
- But `A` _can_ talk to `B` because it’s already inside.
- So you **“pivot” through `A`** to get to `B`.

🧪 **Real-World Example:**

> You hack into a machine used by engineers. That machine is connected to both the office network and a secret internal network. You use that engineer's machine to sneak into the secret network.
