## What is `sshuttle`?

**`sshuttle`** is a special tool that lets you **easily send all your network traffic through a pivot machine (like an Ubuntu server)** using **just SSH**.

Think of it like:

> "I want to access an internal network (172.16.5.0/23), but I canâ€™t see it directly. Let me jump through a middleman (pivot server) who _can_ see it â€” and `sshuttle` will do the hard work for me."

## Why is `sshuttle` Useful?

Normally, when you pivot, you need to:
- Configure `proxychains`
- Set up `SOCKS proxies`
- Tweak tools to work with those proxies

Thatâ€™s **a lot of setup**.

`sshuttle` makes it easy by:  
âœ… Setting up **iptables** rules automatically  
âœ… Forwarding traffic **transparently**  
âœ… Letting **tools like Nmap** work directly â€” no proxychains needed  
âœ… No need to modify your commands!

### Step 1: Install sshuttle
```bash
sudo apt-get install sshuttle
```

### Step 2: Run sshuttle to Start the Tunnel
```bash
sudo sshuttle -r ubuntu@10.129.202.64 172.16.5.0/23 -v
```

What this means:

- `-r ubuntu@10.129.202.64` â†’ SSH into the pivot machine (Ubuntu).
- `172.16.5.0/23` â†’ Route **this internal network** through the pivot.
- `-v` â†’ Verbose (show what's happening).

Youâ€™ll be prompted for the password (`HTB_@cademy_stdnt!`).

âœ… Now, your system silently sends any traffic for `172.16.5.x` through the pivot box!

### Step 3: Use Tools Like Nmap â€” No Proxy Needed
```bash
nmap -v -sV -p3389 172.16.5.19 -A -Pn
```
ðŸ’¡ Even though you canâ€™t _directly_ reach 172.16.5.19 from your machine, sshuttle makes it feel like you can.
