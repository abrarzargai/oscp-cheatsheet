- Tunneling means **hiding or wrapping your network traffic inside another kind of traffic**.
- It's like **putting a secret message inside a teddy bear** and mailing it. It looks innocent, but there’s something hidden inside.

🔐 Tunneling is useful when:

- You want to hide your activities from security tools.
- You want to securely send commands or data through a system that might normally block you.

🧪 **Real-World Example:**

> You send your hacker commands inside normal-looking web traffic (like a browser talking to a website), so firewalls don’t block it.

📦 Some tools that do this: VPNs, SSH tunnels, HTTP/HTTPS traffic hiding.


### SSH tunnel

```bash
ssh -L 8088:localhost:8080 username@target-ip
```
