## What Is Proxychains?

**Proxychains** is a Linux tool that lets you **force any program (like Nmap, Firefox, Metasploit, etc.) to go through a proxy** instead of directly connecting to the internet or a remote network.
### Why would you want this?
Imagine this:
- You hacked into a machine (`Ubuntu target`) that's inside a private network (172.16.x.x).
- From your own machine, you **cannot** reach 172.16.x.x.
- But the hacked Ubuntu machine **can**.

üí° So, what if you could ask your tools (like Nmap) to act like they're **running inside that hacked machine**?
That‚Äôs exactly what **proxychains** does ‚Äî it sends your tool‚Äôs traffic **through the hacked machine**, using a **SOCKS proxy** tunnel.

## **STEP 1Ô∏è‚É£: SSH into the Target with a Dynamic SOCKS Proxy**

A **SOCKS proxy** is a general-purpose tunnel that allows **any kind of TCP traffic** (e.g., web, SSH, RDP) to pass through it.
```bash
ssh -D 9050 ubuntu@10.129.202.64
```

This means:

üß† **‚ÄúCreate a SOCKS proxy on my local machine (port 9050), and send all that traffic through the SSH tunnel to the Ubuntu box.‚Äù**

So now your **own laptop is acting like it‚Äôs inside the Ubuntu box**, thanks to this dynamic proxy.

## **STEP 2Ô∏è‚É£: Edit the Proxychains Config File**

Open `/etc/proxychains.conf` and scroll to the bottom.

Add or verify this line exists:
```bash
socks4 127.0.0.1 9050
```
This tells Proxychains:

> ‚ÄúSend all traffic through the SOCKS proxy on localhost port 9050.‚Äù

#### Use Proxychains to Scan Internal Network**

Now use proxychains with `nmap`:
```bash
proxychains nmap -v -Pn -sT 172.16.5.19
```

#### Use Metasploit Over Proxychains**
```bash
proxychains msfconsole
use auxiliary/scanner/rdp/rdp_scanner
set RHOSTS 172.16.5.19
run
```

#### RDP into the Internal Host**
```bash
proxychains xfreerdp /v:172.16.5.19 /u:victor /p:pass@123
```
