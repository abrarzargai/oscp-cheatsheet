### **1. Pivoting**

**"Using a hacked computer as a bridge to reach other hidden computers."**

- Example: You hack a **WiFi router**, then use it to attack **devices connected to it** (like security cameras).
    

### **2. Tunneling**

**"Hiding your hacker traffic inside normal-looking traffic (like a secret note in a pizza delivery)."**

- Example: Sending malware inside **fake YouTube requests** to trick firewalls.
    

### **3. Port Forwarding**

**"Creating a secret tunnel to access blocked services (like a hidden backdoor)."**

- Example: You can’t directly connect to a **company database**, but a hacked server can → Forward its access to **your PC**.
