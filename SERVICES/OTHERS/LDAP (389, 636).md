## **What is LDAP?**

LDAP (Lightweight Directory Access Protocol) is like a phonebook for a company’s network. It stores info about users (usernames, passwords, emails, etc.) and helps manage who can access what.

- **LDAP Injection** – Hackers can trick the system by sending special characters (`*`, `|`, `&`) in login forms to bypass security.
	-  Enter `*` in **both** username & password → Often grants access.




```bash
nmap -p 389,636 --script ldap-search <IP>

#ldap search 
ldapsearch -H ldap://<IP>:389 -x -b "dc=example,dc=com" "(objectClass=*)"
```
