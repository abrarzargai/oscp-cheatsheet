# Note

- `You can find Common web ports: 80, 81, 443, 8000, 8080 etc`
- `Run Nmap aggressive scan to detect web services:`
```bash
nmap -sC -sV -A -T4 -Pn -p80,81,8000,8080,443 <ip>
```
- `Look for web server version in the scan results and Google it for known exploits`
- `Watch for interesting files/directories: robots.txt, index.html, index.php, login.php, cgi-bin/, cgi-sys/, cgi-mod/`

- `If the website shows a host/domain error then Add the domain to /etc/hosts After adding, visit the site using the domain name in your browse`
```bash
sudo nano /etc/hosts
<ip>  domain.name
```
- `If you find any CMS like WordPress, Joomla, etc., simply search on Google for default credentials or exploits of theme, plugin, version etc. In the case of a login page, you can exploit SQL injection and launch a brute-force attack with Hydra. If you identify any CMS, scan it with tools, perform enumeration with brute force, check default usernames and passwords, explore themes, plugins, version exploits, and search on Google. Alternatively, you can discover web vulnerabilities to gain initial access.`
