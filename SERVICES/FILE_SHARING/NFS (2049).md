## üß† What is NFS?

**NFS = Network File System**

- It lets computers **share folders over a network**.
- Think of it like **plugging a USB drive into another computer**, but instead of USB, you're connecting over a network.
- Mainly used in **Linux or Unix** systems.
- Example use: A company wants multiple computers to **access the same shared folder**, like a team folder.

#### Show Available NFS Shares

```bash
showmount -e <IP_ADDRESS>
```

## üóÇÔ∏è What is Mounting?

**Mounting** means:  
‚û°Ô∏è "Attach this remote folder to my local system."

So, after mounting an NFS share, you can go into it just like a normal folder.

### Example:
```bash
mkdir target-NFS         # Create an empty folder
sudo mount -t nfs 10.10.10.10:/mnt/nfs ./target-NFS -o nolock
cd target-NFS
```
Now you‚Äôre **inside the remote folder**, even though it's stored on a different machine!

## üö´ What is Unmounting?

**Unmounting** means:  
‚û°Ô∏è "Detach this remote folder from my system."

When you're done using the shared folder, you should unmount it:
```bash
cd ..
sudo umount ./target-NFS
```
This **safely closes** your connection to the shared NFS folder.

## Common NFS Misconfigurations:

|Setting|What it does|Why it's risky|
|---|---|---|
|`rw`|Read/Write access|Attacker can edit or upload files|
|`no_root_squash`|Root remains root|Full control if attacker is root|
|`insecure`|Allow high ports|Easier to attack from non-root|
|`no_subtree_check`|Skip directory checks|Less secure, slightly faster|

## What to Look For:

- Files like `id_rsa`, `backup.sh`, `flag.txt`.
- Check file owners ‚Äî you might **create a user with the same UID** to edit the file.
- If `no_root_squash` is set, you can run a **custom root shell** via SUID.
